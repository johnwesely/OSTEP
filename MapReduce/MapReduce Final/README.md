Implementation of Google's MapReduce for Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau.  
The user supplies their own map and reduce functions and the MapReduce program distributes the work amongst a user specified number of map and reduce threads.   
See MR_User.c for an example of how a user can use MapReduce to preform a word count on an arbitrary number of files.
